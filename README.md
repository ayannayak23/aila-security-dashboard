## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on the **security vulnerability assessment of the Aila – AI Teaching Assistant**.  
The goal is to identify and analyze potential vulnerabilities in the web application, visualize them through an interactive **security dashboard**, and implement a module to test **AI prompt injection vulnerabilities**.

This project goes beyond a static report by providing a **hands-on web-based dashboard** where users can explore vulnerabilities, review their severity, and learn about mitigation techniques.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Conduct a vulnerability assessment** of Aila’s source code and API to identify potential security issues (e.g., authentication flaws, insecure API keys, prompt injection risks).  
2. **Develop a web-based dashboard** that:
   - Displays detected vulnerabilities in a clear and visual format (severity charts, category filters).  
   - Allows users to explore each issue with descriptions, risk levels, and suggested fixes.  
3. **Integrate an AI Prompt Injection Tester** module where users can:
   - Input or simulate prompts to test for injection vulnerabilities.
   - View results and recommendations for prompt hardening.  
4. **Provide a final security report and proposed safeguarding mechanisms.**
