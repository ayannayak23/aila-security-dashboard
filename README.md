🛡️ Aila Security Dashboard
Vulnerability Assessment and Prompt Injection Testing Tool

Author: Ayan Nayak
Supervisor: Dr. Farhana Liza

📘 Overview

This project focuses on the security vulnerability assessment of the Aila – AI Teaching Assistant. The goal is to identify and analyze potential vulnerabilities in the web application, visualize them through an interactive security dashboard, and implement a module to test AI prompt injection vulnerabilities.

Employers often value interactive, demonstrable tools, so this project goes beyond a static report by providing a hands-on web-based dashboard where users can explore vulnerabilities, review their severity, and learn about mitigation techniques.
